# Emotions-Detector-App
## overview 
The Emotion Detector is a deep learning project designed to recognize human emotions in images. It utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify emotions into three categories: sad, angry, and happy. The project involves web scraping to gather a diverse dataset of images representing each emotion, data preprocessing to clean and organize the dataset, model training using CNNs, and deployment of the trained model as an API using Python.
