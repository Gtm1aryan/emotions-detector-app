# Emotions-Detector-App
## overview 
The Emotion Detector is a deep learning project designed to recognize human emotions in images. It utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify emotions into three categories: sad, angry, and happy. The project involves web scraping to gather a diverse dataset of images representing each emotion, data preprocessing to clean and organize the dataset, model training using CNNs, and deployment of the trained model as an API using Python.

## About this project
The main objective was very simple, to display emotions based on the facial expressions that we make in front of our camera.
Once the app detects your face it do these things:
- It scan the face in image by haarcascade_frontalface [Link](https://github.com/enespolat25/OpenCV-1-2-3-4/blob/master/haarcascade-frontalface-default.xml)
- It pridect the probability of the outcome in %.
- It print result using green color same as the box color.
